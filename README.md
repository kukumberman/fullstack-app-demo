# fullstack-app-demo

## Description

This project ain't fullstack application. At the moment only server logic is present, mainly is to authorize user via social platforms.

For unknown reason I've burned out :clown_face:

## Functionality

- User login and registration via **unique login** + **password** (not yet hashing used)
- **JWT** authorization (not yet full cycle via refresh token)
- Abstract user service - stored locally in `.json` file, easy to implement other behaviour (like database storage)
- Authorization via social platforms like **Discord** and **Google**
- Unit tests
